# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## My Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the 8 hour day. 



## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Application Instruction

The app should:

* Allow a user to plan their working day in hourly increments from 09:00hrs to 17:00hrs.
 
* Allow a user to clear any entered information stored so the planner can be untilised for the next working day.
 
* Each hour during this time period is Color-code to show whether the hour is past, present or future.
 
* When a user enters their data and clicks save, then a popup will appear temporaryily to confirm the information has been saved to localStorage.



The following images demonstrates the application functionality:
